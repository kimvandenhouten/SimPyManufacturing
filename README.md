SimPyManufacturing
====
This repository contains the implementation of the algorithms described in the paper:

Van Den Houten, K., De Weerdt, M., Tax, D. M., Freydell, E., Christoupoulou, E., & Nati, A. (2023, December). Rolling-Horizon Simulation Optimization For A Multi-Objective Biomanufacturing Scheduling Problem. In 2023 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC) (pp. 1912-1923). IEEE.

``SimPyManufacturing`` contains a Discrete-Event Simulation tool, implemented in Python with help of the Python library SimPy.
The simulation tool reflects a manufacturing site, that represent biomanufacturing factories. The simulation tool can function as an evaluator within simheuristics. 

To set up the environment, use the command ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in the terminal.

SimPyManufacturing is documented, see: https://simpymanufacturing-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html. 

To run a simple example use ``example.py``.
